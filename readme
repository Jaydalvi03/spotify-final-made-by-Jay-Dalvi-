  A lightweight, dynamic, and fully responsive web project built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed for clarity, accessibility, and smooth interactions without any frameworks or build tools.

  ## Demo
  Open `index.html` in any modern browser. No server required. For live-reload while developing, use a simple local server:
  - Python: `python -m http.server`
  - Node: `npx serve`

  ## Features
  - Responsive layout that adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop.
  - Dynamic UI elements using vanilla JavaScript (navigation, modals, interactive lists).
  - Mobile-first CSS with flexible grid and flexbox patterns.
  - Accessible markup (semantic elements, focus states, ARIA where needed).
  - Lightweight: no external libraries, minimal assets for fast loading.

  ## Project structure (example)
  - index.html — main page
  - css/ — styles (responsive, variables, utilities)
  - js/ — interactive scripts (no transpilation)
  - assets/ — images, icons, fonts

  Adjust names to match your repo.

  ## How to contribute
  - Open an issue with clear reproduction steps.
  - Fork, branch, and submit PRs with focused changes.
  - Keep JavaScript vanilla and CSS simple; add comments for nontrivial logic.

  ## Accessibility & Performance
  - Use semantic HTML tags and meaningful alt text.
  - Keyboard navigable components and visible focus indicators.
  - Optimize images and avoid blocking main thread work.
  - Test with Lighthouse and common screen readers.

  ## Customization
  - Change theme colors in the CSS variables file.
  - Add new sections by copying the HTML component pattern and wiring any needed JS.
  - Keep styles modular and reuse utility classes.
